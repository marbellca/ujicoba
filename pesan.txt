I don't wanna tiptoe, but I don't wanna hide
But I don't wanna feed this monstrous fire
Just wanna let this story die
And I'll be alright
We can't be friends
But I'd like to just pretend
You cling to your papers and pens
Wait until you like me again
Wait for your love
Love, I'll wait for your love
